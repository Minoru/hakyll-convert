If you don't agree with us on that point, use <code>--output-format</code> flag to specify your own output filename format.</li>\n</ul>\nThis blog supports hakyll-convert by proving a set of test posts that can be exported and then used as a testing input for the program.\n\n\n<h3 id='hakyll-convert-comments-title'>Comments</h3>\n<div class='hakyll-convert-comment'>\n<p class='hakyll-convert-comment-date'>On 2017-09-02 21:28:46, minorusan wrote:</p>\n<div class='hakyll-convert-comment-body'>\nThis is an example comment.\n</div>\n</div>", dpTitle = Just "Announcing testing blog for hakyll-convert", dpTags = [], dpCategories = ["Uncategorized"], dpDate = 2017-09-02 21:25:14 UTC}
