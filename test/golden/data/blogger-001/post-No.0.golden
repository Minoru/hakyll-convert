If you don\8217t agree with us on that point, use <code>--output-format</code> flag to specify your own output filename format.</li></ul>This blog supports hakyll-convert by proving a set of test posts that can be exported and then used as a testing input for the program. \n\n<h3 id='hakyll-convert-comments-title'>Comments</h3>\n<div class='hakyll-convert-comment'>\n<p class='hakyll-convert-comment-date'>On 2017-09-02T14:45:23.302-07:00, Minoru wrote:</p>\n<div class='hakyll-convert-comment-body'>\nThis is an example comment.\n</div>\n</div>", dpTitle = Nothing, dpTags = [], dpCategories = [], dpDate = 2017-09-02 21:44:00.002 UTC}
