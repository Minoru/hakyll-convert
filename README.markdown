Hakyll-convert provides a library and utility that allows you to import
blogs from a variety of engines (currently, Blogger) to the
[hakyll][hakyll] static site generator.

We aim to

* avoid converting your content between formats (it usually comes in
  HTML and should stay as such without passing through filters)
* allow for the possibility of [Cool URIs][cool-uris] by keeping
  relative page names the same as on your old blog
